# Abstract

This project is designed to help computer science students to create a heavy
relation with its journey about mathematics using haskell to understand the
fundamentals of computer science and discrete mathematics.

# Goal

The main target of this repository is use git to save all the solutions of book
exercises explaining really easily the mathematics concepts envolved
as well the Haskell too.
